# What is doc/fin

The reason `doc/*.md` exists is to document the source code (though, honestly, it didn't do much). The reason this subdirectory exists is to compose a final report to our teacher.

Yet, if you really read it (which you won't), you'll see this is nothing like a serious report; at least, not a good one. This repository is also not a good one. It's pathetic. Frankly speaking, I lack both motivation and respect to do anything for these mfs.

As I write this, I'm in my fifth year of programming. To this point, none of what is presented here evokes even the slightest hint of self-satisfaction for me. No challenge, no technique, no discovery, no anything â€“ it's peak mundanity; like all other computer subjects I've been taking in this university for the past two years. Every few days, I wake up, do some assignments, and see nothing sparkles a minuscule of interest. Still, I have to write dozens of lines because there's some ape-level procedures/functions that needed to be implemented. Ironically, writing this silly 'README.md' might be the most amusing thing I've done in this entire project.

I genuinely miss this day, a year ago, when I still cared for ICPC and related matters. It was a time when I believed in the alignment of what I love, what I do, and what I were studying. I'm still waiting for that sense of belief to return. The challenging part now is figuring out what to do during the wait.
