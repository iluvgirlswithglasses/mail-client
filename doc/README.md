# Introduction

The documentations of this repository are divided into two categories:

1. Those that describe the source code. They're placed in this directory, and they're a way to communicate between developers. You wouldn't read them.
2. Those that describe what this repository does. You should find it in the `./fin` directory right there.

By the time I'm writing this, I should have completed the documents of all of my works here already. They should be `communication.md`, `smtp.md`, `config.md`, and `inbox-refresh.md`. And... while waiting for my teammates to get their job done, why don't I tell you a story?

Every day you wake up as a developer, there's 5% chance you'll get *that* urge to start a side-project. You may think that doing such a project contributes nothing to your employment, or career. However, it does. It's obvious that you'll learn things; but what may not be apparent is the extent of your learningâ€”far beyond what you might imagine.

For me, from this repository, I learnt that the next time I put my hand on these python assignments, I gonna use Django to build GUI /s
